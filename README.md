Calvin is a chess engine written in Java. 

It features a a traditional alpha-beta search algorithm paired with an NNUE evaluation function. 

The NNUE neural network was trained using [bullet](https://github.com/jw1912/bullet) on a dataset of 470 million positions taken from the [Leela Chess Zero dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/linrock/t77dec2021-t78janfeb2022-t80apr2022), that I re-scored using Calvin's own search and HCE. The network architecture is (768->384)x2->1. 

Calvin is rated roughly 3170 elo (~120th place) on the [Computer Chess Rating Lists](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/) leaderboards, and is currently playing on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/Calvin_Bot).

My aim with this project was to combine my passion (playing mediocre chess) with my profession (writing mediocre code). My secondary goal was to learn about chess programming. I have certainly learned a great deal, and I hope that my code is well-documented so that first-time readers can learn too. If you find some information is missing or poorly explained, don't hesitate to let me know!

## How to Play

Like most engines, Calvin does not implement its own user interface. Instead, it communicates using the [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) protocol, meaning it can either be used directly from the command line, or via any popular chess GUI, such as [Arena Chess](http://www.playwitharena.de/), [Banksia](https://banksiagui.com/) or [Cute Chess](https://cutechess.com/).

To run Calvin locally, you will need Java (minimum Java 17) installed on your machine. The binary calvin.jar can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/kelseyde/calvin-chess-engine/releases/tag/4.0.0) section. Start up Calvin by executing the command:

```
java --add-modules jdk.incubator.vector -jar calvin-chess-engine-4.0.1.jar
```
Please note the '--add-modules jdk.incubator.vector' - Calvin uses the incubator Vector API for SIMD operations during NNUE inference, and this module needs to enabled explicitly.

From there, use the "help" option or refer to UCI documentation for further information on available commands.

## Features

### Board representation / Move Generation

- Calvin uses [Bitboards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards) for internal board representation. Bitboards are considered the state-of-the-art for tracking board state, and consistently outperform the more intuitive [Mailbox](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Mailbox) approach. 
- [Move generation](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Move_Generation) algorithms are divided into two camps: legal and pseudo-legal. Calvin features legal movegen.
- For sliding pieces (bishops, rooks & queens), Calvin uses  [Magic Bitboards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Magic_Bitboards).


### Search

- Calvin features a classical [Alpha-Beta](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Alpha-Beta) minimax search algorithm to explore the game tree. This is further enhanced by techniques such as [Principal Variation Search](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Principal_Variation_Search), [Iterative Deepening](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Iterative_Deepening), and [Quiescence Search](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Quiescence_Search).
- [Transposition table](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Transposition_Table) - A transposition table is an in-memory hashtable recording information of all the previously visited positions in the search, which helps drastically cut down on the search space, since the searcher will encounter the same positions from multiple different move orders. [Zobrist hashing](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Zobrist_Hashing) is used to create the hash index.
- [Parallel Search](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Parallel_Search) - [Lazy SMP](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Lazy_SMP) is implemented for multi-threaded parallel search.
- [Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Pruning) - Calvin employs multiple heuristics to cut down on the search space, including [Null-Move Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Null_Move_Pruning), [Futility Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Futility_Pruning), [Reverse Futility Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Reverse_Futility_Pruning), [Late Move Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Late_Move_Reductions) and [Delta Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Delta_Pruning)
- Like many engines Calvin also uses [Search Extensions](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Extensions) and [Search Reductions](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Reductions) to dynamically alter the depth a position is searched. These include the [Check Extension](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Check_Extensions) and [Late Move Reductions](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Late_Move_Reductions).

### Move Ordering
- Captures are ordered using the [MVV-LVA](https://www.chessprogramming.org/MVV-LVA) (Most-Valuable-Victim, Least-Valuable-Attacker) heuristic.
- Non-captures are ordered using the [Killer move](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Killer_Move) and [History](https://www.chessprogramming.org/History_Heuristic) heuristics.

### Communication
- Calvin communicates using the Universal Chess Interface [(UCI) protocol](https://www.chessprogramming.org/UCI).
- [Pondering](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Pondering), where the engine thinks on the opponent's move. Can be disabled using the 'Ponder' UCI option.
- Hash size and number of search threads are also configurable via UCI.
- Calvin is connected to Lichess where he plays regularly in the engine pool: https://lichess.org/@/Calvin_Bot

## Special Thanks To...

- The [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org) - A brilliant resource for all chess engine programmers, this wiki has been my go-to reference for every new topic.
- The kind folks in the Engine Programming Discord server, who were very helpful for answering my various questions related to NNUE implementation.
- The [TalkChess forums](https://talkchess.com/) - The home for chess engine geeks to talk about geeky chess engine stuff.
- Other engines - I have drawn inspiration from countless others' engines, including but not limited to: [Chess Coding Adventure](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Coding-Adventure) (whose Youtube video inspired me to write my own engine); [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) (the queen of all engines); [Leorik](https://github.com/lithander/Leorik) (whose author keeps an excellent devlog on the TalkChess forum); [Lynx](https://github.com/lynx-chess/Lynx) (my frequent Lichess rival); [Rustic](https://github.com/mvanthoor/rustic), [Simbelyne](https://github.com/sroelants/simbelmyne) and [Mantissa](https://github.com/jtheardw/mantissa) (who taught me that Rust is Cool); and many others.
