Calvin is a superhuman chess engine written in Java. 

It features a a traditional alpha-beta search algorithm paired with an NNUE evaluation function. 

The NNUE neural network was trained using [bullet](https://github.com/jw1912/bullet) on a dataset of 1.2 billion positions taken from the [Leela dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/linrock/t77dec2021-t78janfeb2022-t80apr2022), that I re-scored using Calvin's own search and evaluation. The network architecture is (768->768)x2->1. 

Calvin is rated roughly 3400 elo (~62nd place) on the [Computer Chess Rating Lists](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/) leaderboards, and is currently playing on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/Calvin_Bot).

My aim with this project was to combine my passion (playing mediocre chess) with my profession (writing mediocre code). My secondary goal was to learn about chess programming. I have certainly learned a great deal, and I hope that my code is well-documented so that first-time readers can learn too. If you find some information is missing or poorly explained, don't hesitate to let me know!

## How to Play

Like most engines, Calvin does not implement its own user interface. Instead, it communicates using the [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) protocol, meaning it can either be used directly from the command line, or via any popular chess GUI, such as [Arena Chess](http://www.playwitharena.de/), [Banksia](https://banksiagui.com/) or [Cute Chess](https://cutechess.com/).

To run Calvin locally, you will need Java (minimum Java 17) installed on your machine. The binary calvin.jar can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/kelseyde/calvin-chess-engine/releases/tag/4.0.0) section. Start up Calvin by executing the command:

```
java --add-modules jdk.incubator.vector -jar calvin-chess-engine-4.0.1.jar
```
From there, use the "help" option or refer to UCI documentation for further information on available commands.

## Features

Calvin features a pretty traditional chess engine architecture. The engine can broadly be split into three parts: Move Generation, Search, and Evaluation.

### Move Generation

Every chess engine requires an internal [board representation](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Board_Representation), in order to track the position of the pieces, the move history, and so on. From there, for any given chess position the engine needs to be able to [generate legal moves](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Move_Generation) for that position, to be used during exploration of the game tree during search. As with everything chess-engine-related, the faster the movegen the better!

- [Legal move generation](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Move_Generation)
- [Bitboards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards)
- [Magic Bitboards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Magic_Bitboards)

### Search

The search algorithm is all about exploring the possible positions in the game tree, in the most efficient manner possible. To achieve this Calvin uses a classical [alpha/beta](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Alpha-Beta) [negamax](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Negamax) algorithm. 

#### Search enhancements

- [Transposition table](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Transposition_Table)
- [Principal Variation Search](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Principal_Variation_Search)
- [Iterative Deepening](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Iterative_Deepening)
- [Quiescence Search](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Quiescence_Search)
- [Zobrist Hashing](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Zobrist_Hashing)
- [Aspiration windows](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Aspiration_Windows)
- [Lazy SMP](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Lazy_SMP)

#### Pruning, reductions, extensions

- [Null-Move Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Null_Move_Pruning)
- [Futility Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Futility_Pruning)
- [Reverse Futility Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Reverse_Futility_Pruning)
- [Delta Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Delta_Pruning)
- [Late Move Reductions](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Late_Move_Reductions)
- [Check Extension](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Check_Extensions)
- [History Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/History_Leaf_Pruning)
- [Razoring](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Razoring)

#### Move ordering

- [MVV](https://www.chessprogramming.org/MVV-LVA) with [Capture History](https://www.chessprogramming.org/History_Heuristic#Capture_History)
- [Killer Heuristic](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Killer_Move)
- [History Heuristic](https://www.chessprogramming.org/History_Heuristic)
- [Continuation History](https://www.chessprogramming.org/History_Heuristic#Continuation_History) (1-ply and 2-ply)

#### Time Management

- Hard/soft time bounds
- Best move stability scaling
- Score stability scaling
- Node TM scaling

#### Communication
- Calvin communicates using the Universal Chess Interface [(UCI) protocol](https://www.chessprogramming.org/UCI).
- [Pondering](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Pondering), where the engine thinks on the opponent's move. Can be disabled using the 'Ponder' UCI option.
- Hash size and number of search threads are also configurable via UCI.
- Calvin is connected to Lichess where he plays regularly in the engine pool: https://lichess.org/@/Calvin_Bot

### Evaluation 

For any given chess position, the engine needs a method of obtaining an estimate of how good the position is for the side to move. Chess engine evaluation mechanisms can be split into two camps: traditional [Hand-Crafted Evaluation](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Evaluation) (HCE), and [Efficiently Updatable Neural Networks](https://www.chessprogramming.org/NNUE) (NNUE). Since version [4.0.0](https://github.com/kelseyde/calvin-chess-engine/releases/tag/4.0.0), Calvin has switched to a neural-net based eval. 

The neural network was trained using the excellent [bullet](https://github.com/jw1912/bullet) trainer on a dataset of 1.2 billion positions taken from the [Leela dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/linrock/t77dec2021-t78janfeb2022-t80apr2022), that I re-scored using Calvin's own search and evaluation. The network architecture is (768->512)x2->1.

- The [TalkChess forums](https://talkchess.com/) - The home for chess engine geeks to talk about geeky chess engine stuff.
- Other engines - I have drawn inspiration from countless others' engines, including but not limited to: [Chess Coding Adventure](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Coding-Adventure) (whose Youtube video inspired me to write my own engine); [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) (the queen of all engines); [Leorik](https://github.com/lithander/Leorik) (whose author keeps an excellent devlog on the TalkChess forum); [Lynx](https://github.com/lynx-chess/Lynx) (my frequent Lichess rival); [Rustic](https://github.com/mvanthoor/rustic), [Simbelyne](https://github.com/sroelants/simbelmyne) and [Mantissa](https://github.com/jtheardw/mantissa) (who taught me that Rust is Cool); and many others.
