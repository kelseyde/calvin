/**
 * The amount of time the engine chooses to search is split into to two limits: hard and soft. The hard limit is checked
 * constantly during search, and the search is aborted as soon as it is reached. The soft limit is checked at the start
 * of each iterative deepening loop, and the engine does not bother starting a new search if it is reached.
 * </p>
 * The idea is that if the engine is unlikely to finish a new iteration before hitting the hard limit, then there's no
 * point starting the iteration, since the time spent doing so is mostly wasted. That time can therefore be saved for
 * subsequent moves.
