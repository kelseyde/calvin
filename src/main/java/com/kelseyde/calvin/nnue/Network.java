    *** WHAT IS NNUE? ***

    NNUE (ƎUИИ Efficiently Updatable Neural Network) is a neural network architecture that takes advantage of the fact
    that, in games like chess, a single move does not change the state of the board that much. Therefore, minimal changes
    are required to update the network inputs between evaluations.
